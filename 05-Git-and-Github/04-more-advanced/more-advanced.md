1. What is the difference between `git reset` and `git revert`. When would you use one over the other? **git reset will reset the state of the branch to a previous state by dropping all the changes post the desired commit while git revert will reset to a previous state by creating new reverting commits and keep the original commits**
2. What is the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`. When would you use one over the other? **Git merge integrates the contents of a source branch with a target branch, while preserving the ancestry of each commit history, whereas Git rebase incorporates all the new commits in the master branch by rewriting the history by creating new commits for each commit in the source branch.** 
3. What is the difference between `git stash pop` and `git stash apply`. When would you use one over the other? **git stash pop throws away the (topmost, by default) stash after applying it, whereas git stash apply leaves it in the stash list for possible later reuse (or you can then git stash drop it)** 
4. What kinds of things can you do in `interactive` mode when rebasing? **Interactive rebasing can be used for changing commits in many ways such as editing, deleting, and squashing.**
